# GIRAF: Graph-based Interface Residue Assessment Function  
This algorithm constructs bipartite graph networks that capture the interfacing residues between two chains in a protein complex.  
GIRAF was designed and works out of the box for INTERCAAT outputs, but could be adapted to other methods.  

Once the graphs are created, you can calculate the graph edit distance (GED) between any pair of graphs to quantify the similarity of the binding interactions.  

## Getting started  
Mamba was used to create a virtual env:  

```
mamba env create -n giraf  
mamba activate giraf  
mamba install networkx pandas matplotlib
```  

The following versions of packages were used:  
 *Python 3.11
 *NetworkX 3.1
 *Pandas 2.0.3
 *Matplotlib 3.7.1  

By default, the script will perform the analysis and display the figures shown in the manuscript.
